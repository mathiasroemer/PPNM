Part A:

We first test the routines on u''=-u

We then try to solve the Lotka-Volterra system

Part B:

We now want to use the routines on u'' + u= 1 + epsilon * u^2

Part C:

We at last want to use the routines on the three-body problem using the initial configuration given by the wikipedia for a stable system with m1=m2=m3=G=1
