Part A:

First we choose the training function to be Cos(5x-1)*Exp(-x*x)
We then generate 100 random points between -1 and 1 as our input training sample (X) with the points evaluated in the training function as the output (Y)
We then initiate the neural network with 3 neurons
The initial network parameters are:
         1          1          1          1          1          1          1          1          1 

We then train the network given X and Y

The network parameters then becomes after training:
    -0.224      0.585       -3.7      0.491      0.381     -0.975     -0.169      0.492       4.98 


Network prediction at 0.2: 0.958830651235292
Real value at 0.2: 0.960789439152323

We then try to calculate the first, second and anti derivative of the training function using the network.
