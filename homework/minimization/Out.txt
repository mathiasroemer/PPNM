Part A:

The Rosenbrock's valley function is: f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100*(y-x^2)^2

We now use Newton's method with a numerical gradient in order to find the minimum. This is done using five different initial start guesses:

Start guess: (2, 2), Global minimum found after 15 steps:
         1          1 
Start guess: (3, 3), Global minimum found after 20 steps:
         1          1 
Start guess: (-3, 3), Global minimum found after 29 steps:
         1          1 
Start guess: (4, -3), Global minimum found after 25 steps:
         1          1 
Start guess: (-10, 10), Global minimum found after 1000 steps:
     -10.9        120 

We see that the minimum is closely around the provided minimum at (a,a^2) = (1,1) given by the wikipedia and that the algorithm stops after 1000 steps in case the convergence criterion cannot be reached.


We now want to use Newton's method with a numerical gradient to find the minima of the Himmelblau's function: f(x,y) = (x^2+y-11)^2+(x+y^2-7)^2
We try now four different intial guesses and get the results:

Initial guess: (10, 10)
Result after 9 steps:

         3          2 

Initial guess: (-7, 7)
Result after 7 steps:

     -2.81       3.13 

Initial guess: (-12, -12)
Result after 8 steps:

     -3.78      -3.28 

Initial guess: (9, -9)
Result after 9 steps:

      3.58      -1.85 

Which are all in agreement with the minima given by the wikipedia.

Part B:

We want to fit the Higgs Boson data to the Breit-Wigner function

Start parameters:       126          2        5.5 
(Should be a fair guess looking at the data)

After 10 minimization steps we find the final parameters:
       126       2.09       9.88 

We find a mass of 125.97 GeV with a resonance width of 2.09 and a scale factor of 9.88

Part C:

We now do the same as for Part A, just with a central finite difference instead of a forward difference
The Rosenbrock's valley function is: f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100*(y-x^2)^2

Start guess: (2, 2), Global minimum found after 15 steps:
         1          1 
Start guess: (3, 3), Global minimum found after 20 steps:
         1          1 
Start guess: (-3, 3), Global minimum found after 29 steps:
         1          1 
Start guess: (4, -3), Global minimum found after 25 steps:
         1          1 
Start guess: (-10, 10), Global minimum found after 52 steps:
         1          1 

We see that the minimum is closely around the provided minimum at (a,a^2) = (1,1) given by the wikipedia and that it this time got the minimum of all the start guesses.


We now want to use Newton's method with a central gradient to find the minima of the Himmelblau's function: f(x,y) = (x^2+y-11)^2+(x+y^2-7)^2
We try now four different intial guesses and get the results:

Initial guess: (10, 10)
Result after 9 steps:

         3          2 

Initial guess: (-7, 7)
Result after 7 steps:

     -2.81       3.13 

Initial guess: (-12, -12)
Result after 8 steps:

     -3.78      -3.28 

Initial guess: (9, -9)
Result after 9 steps:

      3.58      -1.85 

Which are all in agreement with the minima we go from the forward difference.

We see that the central finite difference approximations for the derivatives is better than the forward difference approximations since we not get results for all our guesses.
